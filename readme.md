## About
Naval Chess Unreal is a remastered version of Naval Chess, a turn-based, competitive strategy game made in 2021 using Unity Engine.
This game includes all previous contents along with new visuals featured by Unreal Engine and multiplayer system.

## How To Play
Player can either be the host of a listen server, or the client.
After the matchmaking is complete and two players get together, they will be given the control of team RED or team BLUE.
1. Each player has to buy ship units with limited budget. There are 5 types of unit, and every unit has different features and cost.
2. After both players finalize their team organizations, they have to put the pieces on the gameboard.
3. Player can use 4 APs(Action Points) in total on each turn. Every unit can use up to 3 APs on each turn. Consumed APs are restored at the beginning of the player's next turn. Attacking/Moving consumes 1 AP, but one unit can attack only once on a single turn. The order between the actions doesn't matter.
4. To win, you have to...
- destroy your opponent's base (can be done with a single shot)
- OR, eliminate all enemy units
- OR, place a unit on the far end of the opposite side
...before your opponent does so.
